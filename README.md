## What is JavaScript? 

<details>
<summary>See What is JavaScript details</summary>

Created by Brendan Eich, in 1995, JavaScript is a scripting language that allows developers to implement complex features on web pages beyond simple static content. 

JavaScript (JS) is a versatile, lightweight, interpreted programming language primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic content to web pages, but also used in various other environments like Node.js for server-side development.

## JavaScript Indentation (best practices)

<details>
<summary>See JavaScript Indentation (best practices) details</summary>

Spacing and indentation should be consistent throughout your code. Many developers choose to use 4-space or 2-space indentation. In JavaScript, each nested statement (e.g., a statement following a "&#123;" brace) should be indented exactly once more than the previous line's indentation.

Here are some examples of bad indentation in JavaScript:

## JavaScript Keywords 

<details>
<summary>See JavaScript Keywords details</summary>

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our [Reserved Words Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp) lists all JavaScript keywords.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:


|Keyword|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|var|Declares a variable|
|let|Declares a block variable|
|const|Declares a block constant|
|if|Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition|
|switch|Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases|
|for|Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop|
|function|Declares a function|
|return|Exits a function|
|try|Implements error handling to a block of statements|

</details>

## JavaScript Variables 

<details>
<summary>See JavaScript Variables details</summary>

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

```javascript
let x;
x = 6;
```
</details>

## JavaScript Operators

<details>
<summary>See JavaScript Operators details</summary>

Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for **true** or **false**.

## JavaScript Operators - Comparison

Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

Given that 
```javascript 
x = 5
```

The table below explains the comparison operators:
